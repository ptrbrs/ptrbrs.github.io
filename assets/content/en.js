Maybe he started calling me that because I'm constantly thinking about things that can bring progress, breakthroughs and solutions for any environmental issue. This is where the nickname comes from, which has evolved into a brand name that faithfully reflects my personality.<br><br>The letter <mark>T</mark> in the logo represents my nickname, as well as the symbols of the 4 main natural elements - thereby referring to the main attributes of my thoughts.`,

        details2: `I can't say that I've been interested in what I'm currently doing since I was a kid. I wasn't interested, but I already had the talent for it.<br>I was a super average kid. I already gave up my habit of eating everything in kindergarten. Not even Legos and crystal balls! When I entered school, the feeling of 'I hate everything' could have come. Still, my parents prevented it and took me to the field early so that I could release my excess energy and be at least a little more manageable according to their expectations. I could have been a talented athlete...<br>But my talent began as exploitation and not as a conscious development: the injuries continued, and it became impossible to continue my professional career.<br><br>Thus, the awareness of it and the disappointment led me to other paths of self-realization.<br> Skateboarding could have done better than running, but I liked graffiti in the parks, so I became friends with its creators. I spent a lot of time next to the surfaces - those were legal or not, it didn't matter. But I knew: 'I can't do this forever.' I need to take 1 step beyond...`,

        details3: `I entered the world of advertising entirely by accident — but once it happened, it became an integral part of my life. It has been my work, my profession, and, at times, even my form of recreation. That said, I don't claim it's the only thing I've done. In that part of the world, turning such a path into a lifelong career has always been more of an ideal than a realistic scenario.<br><br>My first job at an advertising company felt more like working in a factory — characterized by monumental yet repetitive tasks. Still, the experience was not without value. I developed a deep understanding of software, workflows, and production processes. However, the environment offered little room for actual creative expression, which led me to seek new challenges.<br><br>I eventually joined a smaller company, where I quickly progressed to the role of senior designer. It was here that I finally had room to move freely and apply my ideas without constraints. I created brand elements, custom graphics, multimedia presentations, vehicle wraps — virtually everything within the realm of creative design. But everything changed after the turn of the millennium.<br></br>I was approached by the founder of the motorcycle apparel brand MUGENRACE to collaborate. The scope of the work extended across borders and cultures, and with it came new, complex challenges. I was tasked with developing the brand's visual identity, designing apparel, and overseeing every aspect of the company’s visual presence. My creative abilities were well suited to the role, but it was the personal development — shaped by international exposure and cultural diversity — that filled in the missing pieces.<br></br>The results speak for themselves. Over nearly two decades, I met every challenge with focus and adaptability. Eventually, I reached a natural transition point: it was time to seek out new goals and opportunities. Graphic design and visual thinking will always be a core part of who I am, but I've also turned my attention to new ideas that demand the same level of creativity, structure, and problem-solving. I continue to apply my experience, discipline, and individual perspective to wherever my work takes me next.`,

        text2: `The logo stands as the central pillar of a modern fulfillment logistics company’s visual identity—engineered around the principles of efficiency, technological precision, and the dynamic nature of contemporary commerce. Its design originates from the letter “W,” a direct reference to the company’s name, while its curved, ribbon-like form symbolizes continuity, seamless processes, and the movement of goods from warehouse shelves to the end customer.<br><br>Within the ribbon’s surface lies a subtly stylized barcode motif—more than a decorative element, it is an emblem of one of logistics’ most essential instruments. The gradual compression and expansion of its lines convey data flow, traceability, and the omnipresence of information technology. The white-to-gray gradient projects metallic sophistication, reflecting the company’s modern infrastructure and reliability, while the thin cyan outline injects a sense of freshness and innovation, anchoring the design firmly in the digital age.<br><br>The result is a logo that is both timeless and contemporary, speaking equally to the trust of partners and the relentless pace of the digital marketplace—a visual manifestation of future-oriented thinking that sustains the company’s position in the unforgiving arena of fulfillment logistics.`,

Their mission and main activity is to maximize the physical and mental condition of professional athletes using their unique formula and procedures, paying special attention to the dynamics and precision of movement.<br><br>During the design, I relied on the basic pillars of the brand: movement and science. The logo depicts the outline of the nerve center of our body embedded in the silhouette of a human figure, in the lines of which I tried to symbolize the vision of the matrix of neural connections. The website technology retained the clean, simple appearance that symbolizes precision. Furthermore, I tried to move the content in moderation to convey the basics of the client's profession.
